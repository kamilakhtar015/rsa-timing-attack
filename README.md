# RSA Timing Attack Simulation

This project demonstrates a **timing side-channel attack** against RSA encryption.  
By measuring decryption times of crafted ciphertexts, an attacker can infer bits of the private key.

It includes a **web-based simulation** for visualizing sender, receiver, and attacker behavior.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pallasite99/rsa-timing-attack.git
cd rsa-timing-attack
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## How to Run

### Option 1: Command-Line Simulation

1. **Start the receiver**:

    ```bash
    python network/receiver.py
    ```

2. **Start the sender** (in a new terminal):

    ```bash
    python network/sender.py
    ```

3. **Start the attacker** (in another terminal):

    ```bash
    python network/attacker.py
    ```

4. **Analyze timing data**:

    ```bash
    python analyze_attack.py
    ```

---

### Option 2: Web-Based Simulation (Flask)

1. **Navigate to the `web/` directory**:

    ```bash
    cd web
    ```

2. **Run the Flask server**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to:

    ```
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

    You will find pages to simulate:
    - Sender
    - Receiver
    - Attacker
    - Real-time timing visualizations
