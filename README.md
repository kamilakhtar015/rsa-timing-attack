# RSA Timing Attack Simulation

This project demonstrates a **timing side-channel attack** on the RSA encryption algorithm. By observing how long it takes the receiver to decrypt various ciphertexts, an attacker can infer patterns that may potentially leak information about the private key.

## üìñ How It Works

This project simulates a basic cryptographic environment involving three actors:

1. **Receiver**
   - Generates an RSA key pair
   - Starts a server that listens for incoming encrypted messages
   - Decrypts messages and returns an ACK

2. **Sender**
   - Reads the public key
   - Encrypts a plaintext message
   - Sends it to the Receiver

3. **Attacker**
   - Reads the same public key
   - Sends multiple crafted ciphertexts
   - Measures the **time taken** by the receiver to decrypt each one
   - Logs this timing information for later analysis

4. **Analyzer**
   - Reads the timing results
   - Produces statistics and a graph showing decryption time per ciphertext
